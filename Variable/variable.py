# Variabel name can only contain alpha_numeric charecters and underscores (A - z , 0 - 9 and _ ).
# variable names are case-sensitive (num, Num, and NUM ) are three different variables 

user_name = "@jack430"
user_id = 202
verified = False

print(user_name, user_id, verified)


points = 100     # declear a variable and assign it to 100

print(points)    # the value of points is 100 here 

points = 210     # reasign the points to 210
print(points)    # now the value of point is 210 


# we can assign a variable to a value  with = sign
